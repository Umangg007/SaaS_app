# Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

## 🚨 "Application exited early" Error

This error typically occurs when:
1. Missing dependencies
2. Environment variables not set
3. Port conflicts
4. Database connection issues

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- Added `mongoose` and `bcryptjs` to `backend/package.json`
- These were being used in `server.js` but not declared as dependencies

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added better MongoDB connection error handling
- Added graceful server shutdown
- Added health check endpoint at root (`/`)

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- More detailed console logs
- Better error messages
- Environment information display

## 🔧 Steps to Fix Your Deployment

### Step 1: Push the Fixed Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues - add missing dependencies and improve error handling"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Check Render Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for any error messages

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
In your Render service, ensure these are set:
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`
- `PORT`: `10000` (or leave empty for auto-assignment)
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `COHERE_API_KEY`: Your Cohere API key (optional)

### Step 4: Test Locally First
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test
```

This will run the test script to verify everything works.

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find module 'mongoose'"
**Solution**: Dependencies are now properly added to `package.json`

### Issue 2: "MongoDB connection failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- Verify network access settings

### Issue 3: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: 
- Remove the `PORT` environment variable from Render
- Let Render assign a port automatically

### Issue 4: "Application exited early"
**Solution**: 
- Check the logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify the build command is correct

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### Check Health Endpoint
Once deployed, visit your backend URL:
```
https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "message": "Sassinator Backend is running! 🚀",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Check API Test Endpoint
```
https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/test
```

## 🔄 Redeployment Process

1. **Push changes to GitHub**
2. **Render will auto-deploy** (if auto-deploy is enabled)
3. **Monitor the logs** for any errors
4. **Test the endpoints** once deployment is complete

## 📞 If Issues Persist

1. **Check Render Status**: Visit [status.render.com](https://status.render.com)
2. **Review Logs**: Look for specific error messages
3. **Test Locally**: Run `npm test` in the backend directory
4. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Status shows "Live" in Render dashboard
- ✅ Health endpoint returns JSON response
- ✅ No errors in the logs
- ✅ MongoDB connects successfully (if configured)
